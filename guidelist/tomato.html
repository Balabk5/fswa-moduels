            <h1>Tomato Cultivation Guide</h1><br>
            <p>Tomato is grown practically in every country of the world in outdoor fields, greenhouses, and net houses. The leading tomato producing countries in the world are China, India, USA, Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Italy, Spain, and Brazil.

            </P><br>
            <P>Tomato is the most widely cultivated crop in India. Tomato is a very important vegetable crop regarding both income and nutrition. Tomatoes are predominantly summer crops, but it can be cultivated throughout the year.

                <h2>Soil</h2>
                <p>Tomato can be grown on a wide range of soils from sandy to heavy clay. However, well-drained, sandy or red loam soils rich in organic matter with a pH range of 6.0-7.0 are considered as ideal.

                </p>
                <h2>Climate</h2>
                <p>The tomato is warm season crop. The temperature of 20-25 °C is considered to be ideal for tomato cultivation, and the excellent quality red color is developed in tomatoes at 21-24 °C temperature. Due to intense heat (temperature above
                    43 °C), the plants get burnt, and flowers and small fruits also fall, whereas less than 13°C and greater than 35 °C decreases the fruits and the red color production ratio.

            <div class="explanation">
                <h2>Land Preparation</h2>
                <p>The field is ploughed to fine tilth by giving four to five ploughing with a sufficient interval between two ploughing. Planking should be done for proper levelling. Furrows are then opened at the recommended spacing. Well-decomposed FYM
                    (25 t/ha) is thoroughly incorporated at the time of land preparation.
                </p>
                <h2>Spacing</h2>
                <p>Spacing depends upon the type of variety grown and the season of planting. Normally the seedlings are transplanted at a spacing of 75-90 x 45-60 cm.

                <p>At the time of land preparation, broadcast and thoroughly mix the well-decomposed FYM at 20 to 25 t/ha in the soil Then add a basal fertilizer dose Nitrogen – 60 kg, Phosphorus – 80 kg and Potash -60 kg Potash per hectare. After 30 to
                    45 days of planting, give 30 kg amount of nitrogen to the crop.

                <h2>Supporting Tomato Plants (Staking)
                </h2>
                <p>The long growing varieties of tomatoes need to be specially supported. At the time of plant growth, plants should be staking with the help of string or wire. With the help of this support, fruits cannot expose to soil and water; hence
                    there is no problem of tomato fruit rotting so that more production can be obtained.
